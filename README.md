## File paths
This website is using Jekyll, if you've never used it before read this section to get some basic understanding about files and directories.

`_layouts` - template for the main page.

`_includes` - HTML structure of the website. Go there if you want -  for example -  add a section or modify classes.

`javascript` - folder with all JavaScript files. Custom and not only.

`stylesheets` - folder with all CSS files. Custom and not only.

There are also markdown files which are the pure content of the website. The main is `index.md` containing the default content.
