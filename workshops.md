## WEEK 2/WORKSHOP 1: FONT DESIGN (TYPOGRAPHY)

*12-15 April, Cantho City*

Teaching Designers: Pierre Marchand, Femke Snelting, Alexandre Leray, Stephanie Villayphou, Pierre Huyghebaert, David Crossland

Description: In this workshop we will look at designing fonts for different use cases be it one the web, be it for mobile devices or be it for print publications. For years the usage of different fonts that could be used on the Internet was often limited due to computer, software and network limitations. Today the possibilities of designers creating interfaces are expanding through projects like the Google Font Project and others. Today many tools are available to design own fonts and develop new streams of income by distributing  artwork. Creating fonts, the art of Typography, for a global audience is a challenge. What if a font would be designed with two or more writing systems in mind from the start? To design a font between European and Asian designers would mean finding a system that can work for both. Working across languages, system vs. element. Licensing. Font = software. Five European designers will work with participants in an intensive and creative atmosphere.

Software used: Inkscape, Gimp, Fontforge, GIT/SVN, FontMatrix, Fonzy/Nancy, ConTeXT

Outcome: A collaborative font-release, available under a free/libre license for download and use.

## WEEK2/WORKSHOP 2: COLLABORATIVE PUBLICATION

*11-14 April, Cantho City*

Teaching Designers: Pierre Marchand, Femke Snelting, Alexandre Leray, Stephanie Villayphou, Pierre Huyghebaert, David Crossland

Description: New products and services enter our lives continously – Twitter, Facebook, Android Apps, new operating systems, and consumer products. Designers work everywhere. They produce new apps for magazines and newspapers, they create 'mash ups' putting data onto maps and create moving images. The goal of this workshop is to use new tools and methods to create a new and original work. We are producing a collaborative publication, both in terms of content and in terms of design. Our point of departure: Continent mapping. We will make use of data gathered during trips (GPS data, photos, notes, directions, manuals, etc.). We will be editing, designing, and developing together. Five European designers will work with participants in an intensive and creative work atmosphere.

Software used: Gimp, Inkscape, Scribus, OpenStreetMap, ConTeXT (pdftk, command line,..)

Outcome: Fanzine. Digitally printed on location, made available through print-on-demand afterwards and under a free/libre license.
